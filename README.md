### Display of results for 120 km/h or higher speed 
If a citizen's speed is 120 km/h or higher, a fine is applicable. In such cases, the speed is multiplied by R10.20 to calculate the total fine. The application then displays the citizen's name, speed, and the resulting fine amount.

### Display of results for below 120 km/h speed
If the speed is below 120 km/h, no fine is payable, and the application provides information about the citizen's name and speed without any fine details.
